# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset -- Summary Data 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Original study used phone’s embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

The data set here took all mean and standard deviation measures from the original study, and reports the average for these measures grouped these by subject and activity performed. Uses training and test data from original database.

For each record it is provided:

- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- Its activity label. 
- Average values for all 68 measurements for triaxial acceleration and gyroscope measures.
